      <h2>Cherry blossom</h2>
      <p>
        Cherry blossoms, or sakura in Japanese, are the flowers of ornamental
        cherry trees in the Prunus subgenus Cerasus. They are native to Japan
        but are widely cultivated in many parts of the world. Cherry blossoms
        are known for their magnificent display of blossoms in the spring,
        ranging from pure white to deep pink.Most of the ornamental cherry trees
        planted in parks and other places for viewing are cultivars developed
        for ornamental purposes from various wild species. In order to create a
        cultivar suitable for viewing, a wild species with characteristics
        suitable for viewing is needed. Prunus speciosa (Oshima cherry), which
        is endemic to Japan, produces many large flowers, is fragrant, easily
        mutates into double flowers and grows rapidly. As a result, various
        cultivars, known as the Cerasus Sato-zakura Group, have been produced
        since the 14th century and continue to contribute greatly to the
        development of hanami (flower viewing) culture. From the modern period,
        cultivars are mainly propagated by grafting, which quickly produces
        cherry trees with the same genetic characteristics as the original
        individuals, and which are excellent to look at.

      <h2>The Mountain</h2>
      <p>
        Mountains are landforms that are at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) higher
        than the surrounding area. They are characterized by steep sides, sharp
        or rounded ridges, and a high point called a peak or summit. Mountains
        can be found all over the world, including in the oceans.High elevations
        on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar
        latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of
        mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals.
        Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be
        used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as
        mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and
        skiing.

      <h2>Nature</h2>
      <p>
        Nature is an inherent character or constitution,particularly of the
        ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature
        refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world,
        including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or
        humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright
        separate and even superior to nature.While the city has its charms,
        nothing compares to the beauty of a tall tree, the sweet smell of
        flowers, or the feeling of a fresh breeze on your face.No matter how
        busy your day may be, take a moment to go outside and enjoy the feeling
        of the sun on your face, or gaze up at the tallest tree in your
        neighborhood.
